Strategic Design
----------------

Having goals is important. While an obvious goal is doing well in the competition, there are other potential goals: aesthetics, design elegance, creativity, coolness factor, etc. As a team, you should decide what goal is the most important for you. However, this page, and |gm0| as a whole, generally focuses on the competitive aspect of FTC.

Decide what you want from your season. Think of some concrete goals: getting into eliminations at a qualifier, winning a state championship as a second pick, being a captain at Championships. This is important, as these goals have significantly different design requirements.

Game Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attention:: **READ THE RULES!** Watching the game animation does not count.

Figure out every potential way to score points, and also find every potential way to enable your alliance partners to score points. An example of the latter would be the role of a feeder bot in Skystone, moving stones to a robot that can stack at the foundation--doing this meant the stacking robot had to move much smaller distances, enabling easier scoring.

Figure out every way to prevent your opponents from scoring. Defense is an extremely powerful technique--when it comes to winning matches, preventing your opponents from scoring is just as valuable as scoring. However, defense should almost always be a secondary concern to scoring--if playing defense slows your alliance's scoring down more than the opponent's alliance, it only makes it easier for them to win.

Make sure you understand the ranking system! Generally, FTC has a win-loss-tie ranking system (Ultimate Goal being an exception), which means your primary goal is to win the match. However, the tiebreakers are also extremely important--if multiple teams go undefeated, tie breakers are what determines who is ranked first. Make sure you prioritize things that increase your ranking.

Chokehold Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A chokehold strategy is a "strategy which, when executed, guarantees victory, independent of any action of your opponents" (Karthik). Figuring out if one exists should be the first step in game analysis. However, the GDC tries its best to design games with no feasible chokehold strategy. Still, by looking for the ideal chokehold strategy--even if one does not exist--you can find the next best thing, which is the best strategy for the game.

.. attention:: If you design for an overpowered strategy, be prepared for the rules to change. In recent years, the GDC has banned overpowered strategies after the season starts (recycling balls in Velocity Vortex,  scoring while in the crater in Rover Ruckus).

Cost-Benefit Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For every task, you must compare the difficulty of accomplishment to the reward of doing so. Here, the strategic value vs. coolness factor often comes up--something that is very difficult and not worth many points is not ideal strategically, but can still be very cool.

The best tasks are those which are relatively easy, yet still earn your alliance many points. Allowing your partner to score more points is almost always as good as scoring them yourself. In addition to this, fairly often, denying your opponent 10 points is just as good as scoring 10 points (however, keep in mind the ranking system--this is not always the case).

Set reasonable goals--a robot that does one thing extremely well is better than a robot that does everything poorly. Any mechanism on a robot has an opportunity cost--every mechanism takes up space, weight, increases complexity and therefore risk of failure, and takes up time. Time being spent on getting something difficult to maybe work is time that is often better spent on driver practice, programming, and making everything that the robot can do extremely consistent.

Priority Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Priority lists are extremely important because it helps make sure your design decisions meet your strategy analysis. They give you a source of truth for when you need to make tough decisions--what is the most important. There should be team consensus on these--you will not always please everyone, but consensus is important, and enabling this consensus is the job of team leaders.

A good way to do this is to have two separate priority lists: one for desired robot qualities, such as size, speed, acceleration, agility, center of gravity, pushing power, etc, and one for robot functionality.

Robot Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every time, the number one priority is driving--if a robot cannot drive, it cannot score points. Even if everything else on a robot fails, with a functional drivetrain, you can play defense--if everything else on a robot works, except the drivetrain, it can do nothing. See the :doc:`/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/index` page for more.

The second priority should be acquiring and releasing game elements--to score, you need to be able to do this, and this is almost always the most time consuming part of cycles. These two tasks should be optimized to be as quick as possible. See the :doc:`/docs/robot-design/active-intake/index`  page for information on game element acquisition.

Golden Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   #. Always build within your teams limits

      - Evaluate your abilities and resources honestly and realistically
      - Limits are defined by personpower, budget, experience
      - Avoid building unecessarily complex functions
      - On the other hand, as you get more experienced, start catiously pushing a few boundaries
   #. If a team has 30 units of robots and functions have maximum of 10 units, better to have 3 functions at 10/10 instead of 5 at 6/10

   -- Karthik Kanagasabapathy, "Effective FIRST Strategies for Design & Competition"

In accordance to these rules, a simple robot which is very consistent in doing what it does will do better than a complex one that only works some of the time.

Tradeoffs
^^^^^^^^^

Engineering is about tradeoffs. That's why the priority list is so important--it helps you make the right tradeoffs. Figure out what you are going to do, and what you are not going to do--the second is just as important as the first, as it can help you stay within your limits. Not doing things on your robot gives you more time to spend on doing driver practice, programming, etc--all of which is also extremely important to winning.

Teams who do more than they are capable of tend to fail--simple robots often do well. Following this, try to maximize functionality with simple additions/modifications to mechanisms: an example of this would be an intake that is also a deposit mechanism. However, keep in mind it this makes it difficult to change one part of the functionality without affecting another.

When making tradeoffs, remember your prioritesâ€”your priorities should dicate your design.

Other Strategic Design Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Doing the strategic analysis is *extremely* important and **MUST** be done. This stage is often skipped by teams by heading into design and implementation--this leads to poor tradeoffs being made. Following from this, you *must* know what you want to do before you try to figure out how to do it--this is why strategic design matters.

When evaluating strategies, it is **extremely** important to be realistic--look at what teams were capable of in past seasons for an idea of what is realistic. Do not only look at top teams when determining this, as that is extremely misleading.

Remember, you have partners. It's okay to dependon them for certain tasks. However, how much you leave to them should be decided by the Golden Rules--be careful not to leave too much in the hands of your partners. Try to identify the different types of robots that will exist, and go through the different permuations of alliances; for example, how would you do with a robot type 'X', against type 'Y' and type 'Z'. Also consider what you would do if you had to play yourselves.
