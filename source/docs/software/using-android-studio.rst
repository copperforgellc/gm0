====================
Using Android Studio
====================
`Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/intro>`_
is an integrated development environment (IDE) for
Android app development based on IntelliJ. It compiles
your code to an apk which is then installed onto the
Robot Controller: either the Control Hub or a
legal Android phone.

Downloading Android Studio
==========================

If you've already downloaded Android Studio, you can
move on to the next step, which is
`setting up the SDK <#setting-up-the-sdk>`_.
Downloading and setting up AS can be seemless:

1. Check to make sure your system meets
the `necessary requirements <https://developer.android.com/studio#Requirements>`_

2. Install the *latest* version of Android Studio
using `this link <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>`_

3. Run the executable and follow the setup wizard and use
any and all recommended development kits
