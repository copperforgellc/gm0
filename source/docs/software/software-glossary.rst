   Disconnect
      A disconnect (DC) is when, for any reason, the robot is not able to be controlled from the gamepad. This can happen for many reasons - static buildup on the robot, a loose cable, or an error in code.

      Generally, most DCs are caused by improper wiring, so wire stress relief is encouraged for all teams (:term:`USB Retention Mount`). They can also be caused by WiFi disconnects, or an ESD (electrostatic discharge) shock to the electronics.

   Driver Station
      The Driver Station (DS) phone refers to the phone that is used by the drive team and connects to the gamepad(s).

   Robot Controller
      The Robot Controller (RC) phone refers to the phone that is on the robot and is connected to the Expansion Hub via the Micro USB cable. This can now be replaced by a Control Hub.
