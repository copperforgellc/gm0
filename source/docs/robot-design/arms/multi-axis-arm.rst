Multi-Axis Arm
==============

A multi-axis arm is an arm which has multiple points of rotation. Multi-axis arms introduce many variables that exponentially complicate matters and can really only be modeled through complex kinematic equations.

.. warning:: This is highly discouraged for inexperienced FTC teams due to the difficulty of building as well as the need for machine tools.
