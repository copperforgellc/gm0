Odometry

.. warning::
    This is a very niche aspect of design in FTC.
    Generally it is something done by more experienced
    teams who have had time to repeatedly test their
    designs and mechanisms with software during
    the off-season.

Odometry is a form of localization that uses data
from sensors like `encoders <#encoders>`_. Localization is a
means for being able to locate the position
of the bot at some point in time. This is useful
for software, but in order to produce accurate
results, teams need to design hardware that
can be used as the sensors for localization.
