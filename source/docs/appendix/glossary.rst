Many terms generally used in FTC and |gm0| that are unfamiliar to teams may be found here. You’ll be able to quickly learn the lingo of FTC!

   COTS
      COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) parts refer to parts that teams can purchase physically or through an online retailer.

      .. warning:: FTC teams are limited to one degree of freedom (with some exceptions) to COTS parts. Therefore, buying a drawer slide is an allowable part, as there is only one degree of freedom, but purchasing a multi-axis arm isn’t.

      However, teams can buy individual parts and assemble them together into a mechanism that has more than one degree of freedom. This doesn’t apply to drivetrain kits.

   Defense
      Defense is a strategy employed with the goal of preventing the opposing alliance from scoring points, or at least significantly slowing the opposition's scoring.

      This strategy can backfire if drivers illegally play defense and incur penalties and/or cards for their alliance. Defense is usually played by obstructing the opposing alliance, either by strategically positioning the robot to obstruct access or pushing another team's robot into a disadvantageous position.
