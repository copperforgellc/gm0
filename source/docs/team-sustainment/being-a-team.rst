Being a Team
=============

A group of individuals is nothing without structure and organization. Learning the individual strengths of each of your teammates to create robots together will turn you into a force fit to conquer even the toughest game challenges. This article covers team organization and collaboration, knowledge sharing, gracious professionalism, and fostering a safe team environment.

Team Organization
-----------------

The first step to organizing a team is determining who does what. Generally, FTC teams are organized into design, assembly / mechanical, software, and outreach squads, with different sub-squads for different tasks - for example, an outreach squad could have a sub-squad working on industry connections. In addition, your team will probably form cross-squad teams, such as your drive team and scouting team.

To effectively manage these squads, you will need to set a carefully chosen leadership structure - leads should possess good delegation skills and be willing to facilitate learning experiences for those assigned to their squad. Optionally, a captain can be chosen as well.

.. tip::
    Each individual member should decide which squad they would like to participate in, as people work better on tasks they care about! In addition, each member should be involved with outreach in some form, as this will improve your judged presentations and teach each member about the importance of service.

Finally, your team will need to decide when it meets. Week to week, this will largely depend on the amount of work that needs to get done, but it’s always recommended to schedule 1-2 mandatory meetings a week, once again to facilitate…

Collaboration
-------------

FTC is built on collaboration! Your teammates should have access to the full suite of CAD designs, robot software, and business documentation. Our team CCs squad leads on business emails, uses Fusion 360 to share CAD designs, and updates robot software on GitHub, all to facilitate collaboration. Ideally, every member will be openly documenting the projects they work on as well. This way, if a member needs to take over or work to improve a project, they can utilize publicly available documentation to do an effective job. You can share information through a shared Google Drive and use Discord to communicate.

The benefit of collaboration is expanded creativity. Your designers probably have different styles of design and mechanical preferences, and your software team has different styles of approaching programming problems. By using collaborative techniques like competitive design and pair programming, you can combine individual styles to create a more complete product.

   This season, two of our designers built an intake. The final design utilized the best design aspects from each prototype and was optimized based on input from both designers!

Obtaining Knowledge
-------------------
Teams should strive to increase their knowledge of FTC design, software, and outreach both before and during the season. The more you know and experience, the easier it will be to tackle engineering challenges you encounter.

Practice over the summer.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summer projects are a great way to explore robot concepts and start outreach. For instance, our team built a tank-style robot to learn more about goBILDA’s tread system and designed a swerve drivetrain to evaluate its effectiveness. These projects allowed us to evaluate certain design concepts, some of which (integrated wire management and claw) made it to our PowerPlay competition robot. In addition, we cultivated professional connections over the summer and hosted a post-season scrimmage, allowing us to start outreach preseason and gain insights that could be helpful for the upcoming season.

Create and utilize resources.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

||gm0|| is a perfect resource to start the learning process! Have your team peruse the resources here, and use that as a starting point for your own knowledge base. Additionally, compiling your own resources will allow your team to explore different techniques and materials, and provide useful documentation for future team members. You could create a library of FTC-legal sensors and goBILDA kits. Make sure to include all your members in these processes.

Cross-train your members.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the most important knowledge-related pointer, in my opinion. Having all your members learn at least one other skill will go a long way towards increasing collaboration and efficiency. Programmers who CAD will be able to design and integrate their own sensor cases, reducing design team workload. Designers who know outreach will be able to write their parts and speak to their designs more effectively in judging. An outreach team that knows nothing about the mechanical and software processes on their robot is effectively useless, so I would especially stress cross-training your outreach members.

Create a training program for your recruits.

Gracious Professionalism
------------------------

Teams should be gracious and professional both at practice and events - stress to your members that each of them is a representative of your team and should follow GP. Encourage them to actively assist other teams both at events and online. Finally, keep an eye on your team and ensure everyone is getting along well and being respectful.

Fostering a Safe Environment
----------------------------

Your team should strive to be as inclusive as possible. Consider a partnership with the LGBTQ+ of FIRST and ensure your queer and gender non-conforming members feel comfortable in your team environment. Ensure other members are not making homophobic, sexist, and racist jokes, and educate them on why they should refrain from doing so. Ensure you are being actively mindful to not create a “boys club” culture where women are objectified and sidelined, and make sure every member feels comfortable in their position.

Team Identity
-------------

FTC has put a larger emphasis on branding and team identity in recent seasons. Create a logo design for your team, and a corresponding style guide on fonts and colors to keep consistency when creating marketing materials. This will make it easier for you to design posters, flyers, t-shirts, stickers, and even branded plates for your robot!
