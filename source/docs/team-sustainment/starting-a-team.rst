Starting a Team
===============

So you want to start an FTC team - here’s how! Here’s a few tips on how to get up and running. This article covers recruiting members and mentors, structuring your team, and pitching your budget.

Reach out locally to recruit members.
-------------------------------------

Chances are, if you’re interested in robotics, you’ll find quite a few people in your area interested in the same thing! Recruiting them is all about spreading your message and sparking interest in your team, and for that, advertising is everything. Make a catchy flyer and hold a couple interest meetings! A handy tip to get people to attend is to bring food - people love free food…

At these interest events, discuss how FTC is interesting and beneficial to those who participate. Make sure to have information for both parents and students! While you’re recruiting, make sure to be inclusive - people may not have figured out that their passions lie within the scope of FIRST, and they may do so in creative ways when given the opportunity!

.. note:: 
    Make sure to get everyone’s contact information so you can reach out to keep them interested.

.. tip:: 
    To ensure a sustainable team, you should recruit from grades 7 upwards if possible to allow for a constant flow of members. The key to sustainability is new faces!

Find mentors.
-------------

It’s understandable if you have difficulty with this step, but it is critically important: good mentors can make the difference between a great season and a horrible one! Note the phrase mentors, rather than mentor. A strong structure of facilitators can assist you with the wide variety of the engineering and business problems you will be tackling throughout the season, while a single mentor can be a valuable asset but only has so much time and expertise to give.

.. warning:: 
    To compete, teams are required to have at least two mentors over the age of 18. Additional mentors can be younger than 18. All mentors must pass FIRST’s Youth Protection Screening, a once-per-year background check for mentors and volunteers. This is all handled by FIRST, and is free.

While parents and other family members can be helpful mentors in a pinch, it’s important to have outside mentorship so that your team can survive even after you graduate.

Now, to find mentors: reaching out to STEM teachers in your area is a great way to find interest, but you can also reach out to local businesses to see if any of their employees would be interested in lending a hand! (See the email guide for more tips.) New recruits can ease this process a little, and if a new mentor knows a team member it’ll make it easier for them to mesh with the rest of the team. Receiving mentorship over text and video is generally less recommended, as in-person mentors can communicate and demonstrate mechanical and software concepts more efficiently.

Generally mentors fall into a few primary roles. Some mentors may be purely technical, offering advice on your robot and engineering documentation; some mentors focus on “soft skills” such as leadership, fundraising, marketing, and team logistics. Many mentors blur the lines between these roles, but some prefer to stick to one area or another. 


.. tip:: 
    Don’t be afraid to involve mentors who aren’t self proclaimed as highly “technical”. They’re sometimes the best ones.

Pick a comfortable structure for your team.
-------------------------------------------

There are 3 common team structures, each with pros and cons:

    .. tab-item:: School Team

        Run as a school-affiliated team/club with school funding. Watch for red tape regarding funds and parts. Also watch for it on the field :)
        
    Advantages
    - Easier to sustain
    - Potential for consistent funding

    Disadvantages
    - Less practice schedule freedom
    - Arbitrary part sourcing restrictions
    - Competing for funding yearly
    - Limited/no summer practice
