Starting a Team
===============

So you want to start an FTC team… but have no clue how! Here’s a few tips on how to get up and running.

Reach out locally to recruit members.
-------------------------------------
Chances are, if you’re interested in robotics, you’ll find quite a few people in your area interested in the same thing! Recruiting them is all about spreading your message and sparking interest in your team, and for that, advertising is everything. Make a catchy flyer and hold a couple interest meetings! A handy tip to get people to attend is to bring food - people love free food…

At these interest events, make sure to get everyone’s contact information to make sure that you can reach out and keep them interested. Talk about why FTC will be interesting and beneficial to the people that attend - and make sure to have information for both parents and students! While you’re recruiting, make sure to be inclusive - people may not have figured out that their passions lie within the scope of FIRST, and they may do so in creative ways when given the opportunity!

.. tip::
   To ensure a sustainable team, you should recruit from **grade 7 upwards** to allow for a constant flow of members. *The key to sustainability is new faces!*

Find mentors.
-------------
It’s understandable if you have difficulty with this step, but it is critically important: a good team of mentors can make the difference between a great season and a horrible one! Note the phrase mentors, rather than mentor. It’s nice to have a strong structure of facilitators, as they can assist you with the wide variety of the engineering and business problems you will be tackling throughout the season. A single mentor can be a valuable asset, but only has so much time and expertise to give.

Now, to find mentors: reaching out to STEM teachers in your area is a great way to find interest, but you can also reach out to local businesses to see if any of their employees would be interested in lending a hand! (See the email guide for more tips.) You can utilize your network of new recruits to ease this process a little, and it’ll make it easier for your new mentors to mesh with the rest of the team. Receiving mentorship over text and video is generally less recommended, as in-person mentors can demonstrate mechanical concepts more efficiently.

.. warning::
    Teams are required to have 2 mentors over the age of 18. Additional mentors can be younger than 18. All mentors must pass FIRST’s Youth Protection Screening.

    Additionally, while parents and other family members can be helpful mentors in a pinch, it’s important to have outside mentorship so that your team can survive even after you graduate.

Pick a comfortable structure for your team.
-------------------------------------------
There are 3 main team structures you can use. Each has its pros and cons:

School Team:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Run as a school-affiliated team/club with school funding. Watch for red tape regarding funds and parts.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~
- Easier to sustain
- Potential for consistent funding

Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Easier to sustain
- Potential for consistent funding

Home Team:
^^^^^^^^^^
Run out of a house or garage. Budget is whatever fundraising you can acquire.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Freer practice schedule
- No part sourcing constraints

Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Harder to obtain sponsorships
- Space/residential constraints

Community Team:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Run out of a 501(c)3. Generally the hardest to set up, but offers the most flexibility.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~
- Potential dedicated practice space
- Freedom of practice schedule
- No part sourcing constraints
- Lucrative for donors (tax writeoffs!)

Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Harder to sustain
- Many administrative tasks

I personally would recommend the community team route, as it offers the most flexibility and impact potential. However, you should pick one that works best for what you want!

.. tip::
    Consider finding a local nonprofit before starting one. Many are happy to expand into STEM if you pitch it convincingly!

Find funding and create your team!
----------------------------------
Ultimately, the way you fund your team is dependent on which team structure you use.

- If you decide to run a school team, you should reach out to your superintendent, school board, and principal. Make sure to loop in a STEM teacher or two, and maybe even a curriculum administrator.
- For home teams, pitch to your parents or guardians! They’ll probably be dealing with a majority of the headache anyways so be nice :)
- Finally, if you’re pitching to a community nonprofit, make sure you highlight how FIRST will help the organization to grow. Offer to volunteer your and your teammates’ time to other STEM programs that the organization runs, and create a symbiotic relationship.

.. tip::
    A value proposition in marketing is a concise statement of the benefits that a company is delivering to customers who buy its products or services. It serves as a declaration of intent, both inside the company and in the marketplace. - `Investopedia <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueproposition.asp/>`_.

All 3 pitches should follow a similar structure; the easiest and most efficient involves a slide deck presentation. Make sure you highlight the value proposition of starting an FTC team: educational experience, building future STEM professionals, increasing the potential of the area’s technology economy, etc. You may not think it’s important, but many decision-makers take these factors into account when deciding to approve your FTC team or not!

Make sure you don’t underpitch your budget needs!
-------------------------------------------------
Here’s a breakdown of a typical FTC season budget:

- A full competition game set will run you $450 / season.
- A competition field will also run you $650, and - unless you take care with the tiles that make it up - it will cost you additional money to replace every 2-3 years.
- A Driver Hub (robot communication device) will cost you $250, a Control Hub (robot control board) will cost $350, and an Expansion Hub (additional control board), will cost another $250. If you’re careful, these are one-time purchases. There are also bundles for slightly cheaper.
- The goBILDA FTC Starter Kit, which is recommended to start you with basic hardware, will run you $600 (with the FTC discount). If you CAD design your robot in advance, you can go cheaper.
- Extra money for sensors and servos - each can run you up to $100 each! Assuming 2 servos and 3 sensors, that’s $500.

The above budget adds up to $3,000 in startup costs, and roughly $2,000 per year. You can definitely start a team on a budget much cheaper than this *(see #12806 Roboken in PowerPlay)*, but if you have the opportunity to pitch a budget, seize it!

If you are unable to achieve this amount of funding, you can make this budget more manageable through several methods:

- Team fees are collected from members as requirements to participate. Try to make these as low as possible (we ask $250 for the regular season) to ensure that members from all socioeconomic backgrounds can participate.
- Fundraising and sponsorship are essential ways to ensure a team’s survival. See the fundraising guide (coming soon) for more.
- Several general cost-saving measures can be employed throughout the season. These include keeping stock of your inventory and not over-ordering parts, treating your parts well, using #black-market on the FTC Discord to obtain used parts, applying for seasonal FTC grants and the goBILDA FTC Discount, and investing in a 3D printer or CNC mill to fabricate your own parts (surprisingly, this saves a lot of money!).

Now what?
---------
You have your team, you have mentors, and you have a budget. Now it’s time to be a team!
