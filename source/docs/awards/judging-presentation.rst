The Judging Process and Presentation
====================================

At the beginning of a competition, teams will have a 5 minute presentation followed by a brief Q&A period where judges can ask questions about the portfolio and presentation. Following this, judges will sometimes do follow up interviews in the pits where they ask teams more questions about specific things to help in their deliberations. This process is as important as your written documentation when it comes to the success of your team in awards.
