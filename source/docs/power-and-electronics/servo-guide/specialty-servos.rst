Specialty Servos
================

In this section we list some :term:`servos <Servo>` with unique features.

goBILDA 5 Turn Torque Servo
---------------------------

This :term:`servo <Servo>` is unusual in that it is able to rotate multiple turns while retaining positioning feedback. Most :term:`servos <Servo>` have 180 degree range; as the name implies the 5 turn servo can turn 5 times when used with a :term:`servo <Servo>` controller capable of 500-2500 microsecond PWM signal, such as REV Expansion Hub. This makes it a great option for powering linear slides (as long as they do not carry too heavy load).

The 5 turn torque servo is available from several vendors including ServoCity and goBILDA, both of which offer 25% discount to FTC teams.
